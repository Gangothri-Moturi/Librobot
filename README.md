Chatbots are computer programs designed to interact with people via a messaging interface, providing them with quick and easy access to information. 
In this project, we will be using the Rasa framework to build a chatbot for a library system. 
The Rasa framework is an open-source tool that allows developers to build conversational AI applications. 
It provides natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, which enable the chatbot to understand and respond to user input. 
To build the chatbot, we will first need to gather data and create a training set for the NLP model. 
Once we have our training set, we can use the Rasa framework to build the NLP model. 
This involves training the model on the training data, testing it to ensure that it can accurately understand and respond to user input, and then deploying it to a server. 
Finally, we will need to integrate the chatbot with the library system's back end, so that it can perform tasks such as searching for books and updating user accounts.
